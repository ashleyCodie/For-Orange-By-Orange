        an online platform designed to support justice-impacted individuals
        during their transition back into society. Our primary goal is to equip
        these individuals with the necessary resources, tools, and knowledge
        required for successful reintegration, reducing recidivism rates, and
        promoting a more inclusive and just community. Here they are able to 
        create a support network with people who know what their struggles are 
        and how to manuver around those challenges. Nobody wants to see these 
        individuals fail, we have paid our dues and  need guidence on how to 
        become productive members of our society! </p>
